## 1. Favorite food this summer

<p><u>My favorite summer food tajadas my mom found a place that delivers them and it is my new favorite food, I highly recomend them they are fried bananas like plantains but they are usualy cut very thin but still thicker than chips and its good however you order them, but with the sause and meat or chicken it is my favorite food.</u></p>
